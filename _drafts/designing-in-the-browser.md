title: Why I wont design in the browser
---

With most of my work I take a somewhat classic design process before writing a line of code. This includes of hand sketches, wireframes and comps which are done in Photoshop, Illustrator, or my new favourite, Sketch.

This website was completely designed in the browser. It's the first time I've tried the approach. I sketched out a couple ideas then jumped right into code. Over the following weeks I iterated, finally settling on what you see here. I'm happy with the results, but the process was not optimal.






There is a lot of hate for Photoshop lately. Is designing in the browser a viable alternative?





To start I only knew that I wanted articles, projects, and an about page. My thoughts for design and layout were not well defined aside from inspirate I had from other personal blogs.

I found a Jekyll theme called Scribble by Mu-an. It looked great and provided a simple layout but quickly I found new inspiration and decided to make changes. Added responsiveness, changed the header, changed the fonts and so on. I spent the next two weeks iterating as new ideas came up. Scope creep hell.

What you see now is the final result (for now). It retains almost none of the original code or design from Scribble and while I think the result is good, the process could have been better.

Questioning and evolving the design process to be more agile is a great thing, but throwing the old methods completely is not ideal. A hybrid approach is best.

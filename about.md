I am passionate about creating great user experiences and inspiring designs for the web. To that extent I am an active [contributor](http://wordpress.org/plugins/enhanced-text-widget/) to WordPress [plugins](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-posts-widget/) and love tinkering with code, design, new software and tools.
